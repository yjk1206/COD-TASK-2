NAME : YALLA NARAYANARAO ID : CT08WX63 DOMAIN : DATA SCIENCE DURATION : "5th MARCH 2025 to 5th MAY 2025” (8 WEEKS) MENTOR NAME : SRAVANI GOUNI DESCRIPTION : The goal of this task is to implement a simple linear regression model using the California housing dataset to predict median house values based on median income. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the model trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). The performance of the model is visualized using plots of the regression line and actual vs. predicted values. The California housing dataset contains various features related to housing in California, but for simplicity, we use only the "Median Income" feature to predict "Median House Value. " We split the data into training and testing sets using an 70-30 split and then train a linear regression model on the training data. The model's predictions on the test set are compared to the actual values to evaluate its performance. CONCLUSION : By implementing this simple linear regression model, we gain valuable insights into the relationship between median income and median house values in California. The model's performance metrics, such as the Mean Squared Error and R-squared values,indicate the model's accuracy and goodness of fit. The regression line plot shows how well the predicted values align with the actual data points, while the actual vs. predicted values plot provides a clear visualzation of the model's predictive accuracy. Despite its simplicity, this linear regression model effectively demonstrates the power of statistical methods in understanding and predicting real-world phenomena.For enhanced insights, additional features and more complex models can be explored, but this basic implementation serves as a foundational example of predictive modeling.
